# Website Builder AI - Interview Script

## Project Overview
"I built an AI-powered website builder that allows users to create websites through natural language prompts. The application runs entirely in the browser using WebContainers technology."

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Interface
- Users describe their desired website in plain English
- AI processes the prompt and generates a step-by-step build plan
- Interactive chat interface for iterative improvements

### 2. Real-time Code Generation
- AI generates actual code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components)
- Files are created and organized in a proper project structure
- Code is displayed in a Monaco editor with syntax highlighting

### 3. Live Preview
- WebContainer technology runs Node.js directly in the browser
- Real-time preview of the generated website
- No server setup required - everything runs client-side

### 4. Interactive Development Environment
- File explorer showing project structure
- Code editor for viewing generated files
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Chat interface for modifications

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **React Router** for navigation between home and builder pages
- **Monaco Editor** for code display with syntax highlighting
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

### Backend Integration
- **Axios** for API communication with AI backend
- **Custom XML parser** to process AI responses into actionable steps
- **WebContainer API** for running Node.js in the browser

### Key Technologies
- **WebContainers**: Enables running full Node.js environment in browser
- **AI Integration**: Processes natural language into structured development steps
- **Real-time File System**: Dynamic file creation and management

## Code Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.tsx          # Landing page with prompt input
│   └── Builder.tsx       # Main development environment
├── components/
│   ├── FileExplorer.tsx  # Project file tree
│   ├── CodeEditor.tsx    # Monaco editor wrapper
│   ├── PreviewFrame.tsx  # Live website preview
│   ├── StepsList.tsx     # Build progress tracking
│   └── TabView.tsx       # Code/Preview switcher

```

### Data Flow
1. User enters prompt on home page
2. Backend processes prompt and returns build steps
3. Steps are parsed and executed to create files
4. Files are mounted in WebContainer
5. Live preview shows running application
6. User can iterate with additional prompts

## Key Challenges Solved

### 1. Browser-based Development Environment
- **Challenge**: Running a full development server in the browser
- **Solution**: WebContainers technology provides Node.js runtime in browser
- **Impact**: No local setup required, works on any device

### 2. AI Response Processing
- **Challenge**: Converting AI responses into actionable code steps
- **Solution**: Custom XML parser that extracts file operations from AI responses
- **Impact**: Structured, reliable code generation process

### 3. Real-time File Management
- **Challenge**: Dynamic file system that updates UI and preview
- **Solution**: State management system that syncs files between UI and WebContainer
- **Impact**: Seamless development experience

## Demo Flow

### 1. Initial Prompt
"Let me show you how a user would create a website. They start by describing what they want..."

### 2. AI Processing
"The AI processes this and creates a structured plan with specific steps..."

### 3. Code Generation
"Watch as the files are created in real-time in the file explorer..."

### 4. Live Preview
"And here's the actual website running in the browser - no server setup needed..."

### 5. Iterative Improvement
"Users can then chat with the AI to make modifications..."

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading of Monaco editor
- Optimized file tree rendering for large projects

### User Experience
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Intuitive file navigation and code viewing

### Scalability
- Modular component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more frameworks (Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- Collaborative editing features
- Template library and project sharing
- Advanced debugging tools
- Deployment integration

## Questions I Can Answer
- Technical implementation details
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Challenges faced and solutions implemented
- Performance considerations
- User experience design choices
- Future roadmap and scalability plans
